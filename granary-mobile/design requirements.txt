**Prompt Title: Modern and Professional UI/UX Design Requirements for Smart Granary System Mobile App**  

**Objective:**  
Design a modern, professional, and intuitive UI for the Smart Granary System mobile app. The design must align with industry best practices and provide a seamless user experience while visually mirroring the web app's layout and structure. The app must present data in an organized, visually appealing way and maintain a clean and eco-friendly theme.

---

### **General Requirements**
1. **Consistency with Web App:**  
   - Ensure the mobile app UI closely mirrors the structure and layout of the web app to maintain familiarity.  
   - Use the same components, design language, and organization of content where applicable.

2. **Modern Look and Feel:**  
   - Use a clean, flat design style with soft shadows and rounded corners for elements like cards, buttons, and containers.  
   - Adopt a minimalist approach with appropriate spacing, alignment, and readable typography.

3. **Responsiveness:**  
   - Ensure the design is fully responsive for different mobile screen sizes.  

4. **User Experience:**  
   - Data visualization should be clear, engaging, and easy to interpret at a glance.  
   - Ensure intuitive navigation, easy-to-read text, and simple interactions.

### **Design Specifications**
#### **Color Palette:**  
- Base colors: Shades of **blue**, **green**, and **white** to emphasize a natural, eco-friendly theme.  
- Use accent colors for status indicators:  
  - Green: Optimal  
  - Yellow: Warning  
  - Red: Critical  

#### **Typography:**  
- Fonts: Use **Poppins**, **Roboto**, or similar modern fonts.  
- Headings: Bold and larger (e.g., 20px-24px).  
- Subheadings: Medium weight, slightly smaller (e.g., 16px-18px).  
- Body text: Regular weight, clear, and readable (e.g., 14px-16px).  

#### **Spacing and Alignment:**  
- Apply consistent spacing (e.g., Tailwind’s `space-y` or `space-x` utilities).  
- Align all elements to a grid system for a clean, organized layout.  

---

### **UI Components**
#### **Headers:**  
- Include a top bar with the app title ("Smart Granary System") and optionally a notification or menu icon.  

#### **Cards:**  
- Display metrics like temperature, humidity, and moisture in **elevated cards** with rounded corners.  
- Include icons and concise labels for better visualization.  

#### **Status Indicators:**  
- Use **colored chips** or badges to show system status (e.g., "Optimal" in green, "Warning" in yellow).  

#### **Charts:**  
- Use interactive, animated charts to display trends (e.g., temperature trend over time).  
- Ensure the charts are labeled clearly, with gridlines and tooltips for data points.  

#### **Navigation:**  
- Include a **bottom navigation bar** with icons and labels for switching between main screens (e.g., Dashboard, Alerts, Settings).  

#### **Alerts Section:**  
- Display recent alerts in an **organized list** format with timestamps, icons, and short descriptions.  
- Group critical alerts for better visibility.  

#### **Animations:**  
- Implement subtle animations for transitions and data loading.

### **Accessibility**
1. Ensure sufficient **contrast** between text and background.  
2. Provide **tooltips** or labels for icons.  
3. Include larger tap targets (e.g., 44x44px) for interactive elements.  

---

### **Technical Requirements**
1. Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling with utility-first classes.  
2. For charts, use libraries such as:  
   - Victory Native  
   - React Native Charts Wrapper  
3. Follow **React Native best practices** to optimize for performance.

---

### **Deliverables**
1. Screens and components that match the visual layout of the web app but optimized for mobile:  
   - Dashboard  
   - Alerts  
   - Settings  
   - Any other web app screen translated into mobile.  
2. Prototypes or mockups in a design tool like **Figma** or **Adobe XD** before development.  
3. Consistent and reusable design elements for future scalability.
